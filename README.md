Publishers' Assistant

May 9, 2019 - This repository has been created for new PubAssist development.  It should remain private until we have a working model.

Publishers' Assistant is a family of products developed for the publishing industry.  There are many peculiarities to the publishing industry.  Over the years, Publishers' Assistant has been enhanced to support the majority of issues that publishers face.  

At the heart of the existing product is an accounting system that handles most business management functions including: invoicing, receipts, inventory control, etc.  What makes PubAssist unique, however, is the ability to automatically track liabilities associated with your sales.  For example, publishers will regularly pay royalties to authors based on the sales of their books.  PubAssist will allow the publisher to establish very sophisticated royalty contracts, and will track royalties automatically, as the user simply enters invoices and receipts for those sales.

PubAssist, however, is a legacy, PC-based product.  This respository is intended for new development of web-based applications using the LAMP stack.  These applications are intended to replace the functions that are unique to PubAssist over time.
